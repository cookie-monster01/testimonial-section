## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to position the quotation image (card__img--position) on all screen-sizes. 

At first, I wanted to avoid media-queries therefore i tried to apply min() and calc() for resposive positioning. But unfortunately I couldn't come to desired results with that, so I used vw unit and media-queries for it to work as per the design.

- CSS grid and Flexbox
- CSS properties
- Learning to write a readable and robust code with Semantic HTML.
