          <h2 class="card__caption">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
            more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="card__text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
              make
              a
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

              for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

          <h2 class="card__caption">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance
            from them and

            <p class="card__text">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
              The program
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

          <h2 class="card__caption">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="card__text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
              structure from
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
              could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! ”</p>
